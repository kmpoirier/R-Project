# R-Project

PoirierRProjectPt1_1.Rmd reads in RTestDATA-1.txt file. RTestDATA.txt contains abundance of diverse bacterial data from a study on gum disease. The code first test the normality of bacterial abundance and then transforms any that is not normal. The code can also make a one-way ANOVA and boxplots comparing a type of bacteria to time, correlation analysis and linear regression to compare different bacterial abundances and ggplots. Lastly, a alpha diversity and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix can be calculated to compare all bacterial abundances together.

PoirierRProjectPt2-1.Rmd reads in a csv file from grassland_data.zip to study the community ecology on grassland data. This R notebook follows a tutorial by Steven Kembel from https://kembellab.ca/r-workshop/biodivR/SK_Biodiversity_R.html.
